Dapeng Feng, a graduate student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, works on computer vision and machine learning.Currently, the research topics Feng has focused on are **visual perception for autonomous driving** and **intelligence decision supporting system**.

## Education
- M.S., Sun Yat-sen University, Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems, 2018 - present, advised by [Associate Professor Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) and [Associate Professor Xiaojun Tan](http://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher02/1372644.htm)
- B.S., Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Computer Science and Technology, 2014 - 2018

## Research
I'm interested in algorithms for **visual perception** (object recognition, localization, segmentation, pose estimation, ...) and **visual reasoning** (answering complex queries, often in natural lanuage, about images). My work explores topics in computer vision and machine/deep/statistical learning.

## Honors & Awards
