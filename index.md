Dapeng Feng, a first-year PhD student at Sun Yat-sen University, works on computer vision and machine learning.Currently, the research topics Feng has focused on are **visual perception for autonomous driving** and **intelligence decision supporting system**.

## Education
- Ph.D., Sun Yat-sen University, Computer Science and Technology, 2021 - Exp. 2025
- M.Eng., Sun Yat-sen University, Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems, 2018 - 2021
- B.Eng., Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Computer Science and Technology, 2014 - 2018

## Research
I'm interested in algorithms for **visual perception** (object recognition, localization, segmentation, pose estimation, ...) and **visual reasoning** (answering complex queries, often in natural lanuage, about images). My work explores topics in computer vision and machine/deep/statistical learning.
